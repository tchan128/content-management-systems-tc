    <h3 align="center">Content Management System</h3>
    <p align="center">
        The motivation for this project is to create a content management system that can keep track of all roles, departments, and employees of a company. I built this project because as companies get bigger it is important to be organized and keep track of the structure of the company. This not only helps the human resources team but will be able to let employees know who to report to and who to go to for certain questions/tasks. This is a system that companies can use if they are looking to find a quick place to develop a company database of all employees, roles, and departments. This app is a solution for users who are looking to keep better track of the company structure in a quick and free way. Through this project, I learned how to build and seed my database and tables. Furthermore, I understood better how to extract exactly the data I need to use to perform certain tasks.

## About the Project

This project is a content management system. The system is built with Javascript, MySQL, and nodeJS. To build and visualize the database, MySQL Workbench was used. In this system, the main components are being able to: view all roles, view all departments, view all employees, add employees, add roles, add departments, and update employee information. Users will be have the ability to see these changes immediately in the system.

## Installation

To be able to use this application, you need to git clone this repository into your local machine. 

Afterward, you can use `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` to build your database and tables and also seed them with data. Once those are completed, you can install packages that are needed to work this program:

```
npm install -y
```

and 

```
npm install mysql
```

Once those are installed, you can go ahead and run this command to start the system

```

## Usage

In this project, a content management system is built to help users browse through roles, departments, and employees of a company. Users of this database can view all roles, view all departments, view all employees, add employees, add roles, add departments, and update employee information. 

- When users `view all roles` they will be able to see all the roles that are in the company, including its salary and department
- When users `view all departments` they will be able to see all the departments in the company
- When users `view all employees` they will be able to see all the employees in the company including their first and last names, roles, and their manager
- When users `add employees` they will be able to add an employee to the database and choose which role they are in and who their manager is 
- When users `add roles` they will be able to add a role to the database and choose which department it falls under
- When users `add department` they will be able to add a department into the database
- When users `update employee information` they will be able to update an employee's role
